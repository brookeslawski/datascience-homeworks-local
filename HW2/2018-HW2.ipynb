When b = 8 bins, there are an equal number of data points in the left 4 bins as in the right 4 bins.

In February 2015, the standard deviation was 7.3 deg F, in March, the standard deviation was 8.3 deg F, continuing onto December when the standard deviation was 9.0 deg F.\n",
    "\n",
    "The months with the highest standard deviation were March (8.3 deg F), November (8.7 deg F), and December (9.0 deg F).  The months with the lowest standard deviation were July and August, which were 4.7 and 7.6 deg F respectively.  Therefore, it is clear that the standard deviation was not consistent across seasons, but it was somewhat consistent within seasons.  "
